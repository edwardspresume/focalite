# Focalite Privacy Policy

Last Updated: September 2025

## Your Privacy Matters

Focalite is a desktop productivity application designed to help you manage focus sessions and break times. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring your data remains under your control.

## Data Collection

Focalite collects and stores the following information **locally on your device only**:

### Usage Data

- Focus session durations and completion counts
- Break session durations and completion counts
- Daily productivity statistics (e.g., per‑day focus/break totals)
- Timer preferences and settings

### Application Settings

- Focus and break duration preferences
- Notification settings
- Theme and color preferences
- Sound and alert preferences

## Data Storage and Processing

### Local Storage Only

- All data is stored exclusively on your device
- Preferences and progress are persisted to local JSON files via the Tauri Store plugin
- Some UI-only preferences (such as theme mode) may use the app’s browser localStorage
- No data is transmitted to external servers
- No cloud synchronization or backup services are used
- Data files are stored in your system's application data directory (paths vary by OS)

### Data Retention

- Data remains on your device until you choose to delete it
- Historical entries are kept locally; charts typically show recent windows (e.g., last 7–30 days) without deleting older entries
- Uninstalling the application does not always remove app data on every OS. To fully remove data, delete the app’s data directory in your system application data location (exact path varies by OS) after uninstalling.

## Data Sharing

### We Do Not Share Your Data

- Focalite does not collect personal information
- No data is sent to the developers or third parties
- No analytics, telemetry, or crash-reporting services are used
- No advertising networks are integrated

## Your Control

### Data Management

- Access your statistics anytime within the application
- To delete data, manually remove the application data directory for Focalite from your system’s application data location after uninstalling (paths vary by OS)

### Permissions

The application may request the following system permissions:

- **Notifications**: To alert you when a break starts and when a break ends (optional)

## Updates to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes in the application. Any updates will be included with application updates, and the "Last Updated" date will be revised accordingly.

## Open Source Transparency

Focalite is an open-source application. You can review our source code to verify our privacy practices at our repository.

## Contact

If you have questions about this privacy policy or how Focalite handles data, please create an issue in our GitHub repository or contact the maintainers through the project page.

## Children's Privacy

Focalite does not knowingly collect data from children under 13. The application functions entirely offline and does not collect personal information from any users.

## Compliance

As a local-only application that does not collect or transmit personal data, Focalite operates in compliance with privacy regulations including GDPR and CCPA by design.
